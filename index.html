                      Maybe I was wrong and you were right<br>
                      But I don't really wanna have this fight<br>
                      I just wanna feel like I belong<br>
                      And every time my heart swings back to you<br>
                      You are my morning and my truth<br>
                      And all that I can do is sing this song<br>
                      It ain't that long, mm<br>
                     And nothing says "I love you" like your eyes<br>
                      Fill my lips with carbon dioxide<br>
                      I just wanna feel like I deserve you<br>
                      'Cause you deserve me<br>
                      Baby, it's the way that you can see<br>
                      What I miss and what I can never be<br>
                      I just wanna feel like I deserve you<br>
                      'Cause you deserve me<br>
                      Maybe you were wrong and I was right<br>
                      I don't care, won't you stay another night?<br>
                      I just need some time to be myself<br>
                      I couldn't say "I need you" on that night<br>
                      When you left and I lost all track of time<br>
                      I just want you close so I can feel you<br>
                      Can you feel me? Mmm<br>
                      And nothing says "I love you" like the words<br>
                      That were never said, but could be heard<br>
                      If only there was peace around us, baby<br>
                      You would hear me<br>
                      And maybe it's the way that lovers do<br>
                      I just want for me what I want for you<br>
                      Only with the sun above us maybe<br>
                      You would see me<br>
                      And even if you leave, I may be fine<br>
                      'Cause my heart, it has its own design<br>
                      And even if you never see it, baby<br>
                      You're all that I need<br>
                      Maybe it's the silence in your eyes<br>
                      Maybe it's the lilac when you're shy<br>
                      Maybe it's the mystery of your love<br>
                      All I need is a sign from the stars above<br>
                      Maybe it's the way that you breathe in me<br>
                      Maybe it's the man that you see in me<br>
                      Maybe it's the fragrance of your hair<br>
                      Yeah, I just wanna kiss you when you're there<br>
                      I just want you all around me, baby<br>
                      Can we make that happen, please?
